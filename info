Welcome to sdb!

sdb is an acronym for simple database

it's not really that simple, but the actual data layout is (for now) quite simple
it's also threaded to allow concurrent access.

Building:

Complie everything in ./src

[optional] build the generated classes into a jar with sdb.Sdb as it's main class

There is a supplied generic build script to do this for you
